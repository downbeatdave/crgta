# The Gorge Technology Alliance
This is the codebase for the new webapp for [The Gorge Technology Alliance](http://crgta.org).

(It's not launched yet, so don't look at the site for a comparison) 

## Purpose
This codebase was created both to benefit the Gorge Tech community and to give [RubyGorge](http://rubygorge.org) a
production application that we can use to help teach Ruby, web application development, and to try
cool new functionality that we want to bring to the Gorge Tech community.

## Usage
1. Fork it and start it up locally.
2. Play around with it and add/fix things. 
3. Send me a pull request, but make your changes nice, so that I can ignore changes that we don't want. 
Also, the usual caveats apply: Don't change things like History, this README, etc.

Changes pulled from users will be added to the eventual "Who are we?" page on the Gorge Technology Alliance site.

## Communication
We don't have a strategy yet, but we will likely have a project on [PivotalTracker](http://pivotaltracker.com) or
another site with tickets, and eventually we'll get a wiki going. For now, you can hit the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/rubygorge) 
on Google Groups to communicate.
